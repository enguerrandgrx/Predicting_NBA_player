# Predicting_NBA_player
The purpose of this report consists on explaining our analysis of the NBA database. As a matter of fact, we aim at providing a shortlist of young players, between ages 20 to 23 with high potential. We will then recommend this resulting list to NBA managers, which will allow them to invest on potential young players today for reasonable costs.
